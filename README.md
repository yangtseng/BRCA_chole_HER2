The paper is currently unavailable

Background: Breast cancer stands as one of the most prevalent malignancies affecting women. As the disease advances, especially with the development of metastases, treatment complexities escalate. Also, pathway alterations within the cancer cells play a pivotal role in driving malignancy, bolstering cancer cell survival, proliferation, and enhancing the therapeutic efficacy.

Methods: In this study, we analyzed single-cell RNA sequencing to delineate functional characteristics of malignant cell subsets in breast cancer patients. Additionally, we examined the relationship between cholesterol biosynthesis and ERBB family using proteomics data from breast cancer cell lines. We also obtained gene expression profile, drug treatment score and cell surface HER2 intensity on breast cancer cell lines to reveal the impact of cholesterol biosynthesis pathways on HER2 expression.

Results: We found that cholesterol biosynthesis pathways were significantly enriched in these malignant cells from single-cell analysis. Furthermore, we unveiled a regulatory relationship between cholesterol biosynthesis and ERBB family, structured in an upstream-downstream manner. Through proteomic analysis of breast cancer cell lines, we revealed a negative correlation between cholesterol biosynthesis and ERBB family. We also demonstrated that cholesterol biosynthesis pathways influence HER2 expression levels, identifying novel combinatorial therapeutic targets for breast cancer treatment.

Conclusion: In summary, our study identified a novel combinatorial therapeutic approach targeting cholesterol biosynthesis and HER2 in breast cancer using single-cell RNA-seq analysis and multi-omics approaches, demonstrating potential synergistic effects through multi-omics analysis and experimental validation across diverse breast cancer cell lines.
